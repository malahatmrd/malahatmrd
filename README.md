I'm a passionate developer with a growing focus on Artificial Intelligence, UI/UX design, and Frontend Development.I enjoy transforming complex data into smart, efficient solutions using tools like Python, scikit-learn, and OpenCV.At the same time, I'm drawn to creating clean, intuitive user interfaces with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as Bootstrap and React.With a strong interest in both logic and visual design, my goal is to build applications that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use.I believe in continuous learning, hands-on experience, and crafting meaningful digital experiences that bring data and design together.
